# Hot-Pockets

## Winning project of the 2020 Boeing University of Bristol Hackathon.
This is a simulation and a flight path optimizer for drones to plan their journeys with energy efficiency in mind. Using thermal drafts and wind paths one can consume significantly less energy with comparable flying time. If used in a business setting this can significantly reduce charging times for a drone fleet thereby increasing availability and resource usage.
